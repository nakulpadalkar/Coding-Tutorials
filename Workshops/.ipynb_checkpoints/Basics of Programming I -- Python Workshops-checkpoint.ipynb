    "## What is Python and Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a programming language, meaning that we can use it to make our computer conduct calculations or manipulate data. Most of the tutorials you will find on the internet might seem really confusing, a lot of them will ask you to use the terminal or some editor such as Atom. That's where Jupyter Notebooks comes in. Essentially, Jupyter Notebooks are a program that allows us to write and run Python code in an envirionment which is much more user friendly and which requires less background knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accessing Jupyter Notebooks --- fill in, either Annaconda or Citrix (waiting on IT)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Working Directories\n",
    "\n",
    "When we are working with any programming language, indeed any program that requires us to read or save data we need to have some understanding about what a 'working directory' is. You can think of a working directory as the location from which your program (in our case, Jupyter Notebooks) operates from. If I want to read data for example, it either needs to be in my working directory or I need to specify the path of the file. We will see an example of this below. This can be a little confusing at first, but for example my home directory is `/Users/varunsatish`. Your working directory can be changed for example to `/Users/varunsatish/Python_Workshops`, however for the moment this isn't too important it's just something you might need to keep in mind for later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Packages are an important part of the Python programming language. You can think of packages as 'add ons' to the language. Some of these packages are really the basis of a lot that you will do in the programming language. A couple of examples are the Numpy and Pandas packages, which we will see a little later. Generally, the syntax for importing packages looks like:`import [package] as [convenient name]`. For example, `import pandas as pd` or `import numpy as np`. If you look online there are names under which packages are imported almost universally.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Troubleshooting \n",
    "\n",
    "The two best troubleshooters anyone who needs to program has in their arsenal are Google and Youtube. If you come across a problem, there has almost definitely been someone who has made a tutorial about it, or a forum post with a solved solution to the problem -- you just need to understand what the question you are asking actually is. Part of this comes with programming literacy, in all seriousness when it comes to learning how to code, the best thing you can do is make sure you have enough understanding not to write code automatically, but so that you  actually can ask the right questions when you inevitably stumble across problems."
